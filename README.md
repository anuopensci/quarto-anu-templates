# Quarto ANU templates

The list of ANU Quarto templates are shown in the table below.


Repo | Template | Description 
--- | --- | ---
`anuopensci/quarto-anu-report` | Report | 



## Getting started

1.  Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
2.  You may need to install Public Sans font if you do not have it. You
    can find it
    [here](https://github.com/anuopensci/quarto-anu-report/tree/main/_extensions/anu-report/assets/webfonts).
3.  The easiest way to edit and render the document is using the
    [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). If you
    prefer not to install R, then you can use VS Code instead.

## Adding new templates

- The preferred method to add new template is to create a repository with the prefix `quarto-anu-` in the `anuopensci` organisation.
- The new repository then should be added into the bottom of the above table.
